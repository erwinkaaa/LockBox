Introduction:

LockBox is an android application for saving passwords. We help people to remember all of their passwords in an easy single application. No data is saved on the server due to privacy, password is a high level of data access. About protection from hackers is we implemented PIN, so everytime the user opens the app, it requires PIN, sets only once and no reset PIN. We inform and recommend users to use common PIN.
